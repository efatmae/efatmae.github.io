Abstract:
==========
Since the Arab spring in 2011, protests have been spreading around the
world for diâ†µerent reasons, often these protests are faced with violent
repression. Studying protest repression requires appropriate datasets.
Existing datasets like GDELT focus mainly on events reported in news
media. However, news media reports have issues including censorship
and coverage bias. Recently, social scientists have started using Machine
Learning (ML) to detect political events, but it is costly and
time consuming to hand label data for training ML models. This paper
proposes using ML and crowdsourcing to detect protest repression
events from Twitter. Our case study is the Turkish Gezi Park protest
in 2013. Our results show that Twitter is a reliable source reflecting
events happening on the ground as soon as they happen. Moreover,
training conventional ML models on crowdsourced labelled data gave
good results with an AUC score of 0.896 to detect protest events and
0.8189 to detect repression events.
