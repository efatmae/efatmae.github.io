Abstract:
==========
Cyberbullying on social media is a threat, especially as gray social media platforms, those with a loose moderation policy on cyberbullying, have been attracting more people. Recently, data collected from these types of platforms have been used to pre-train word embeddings, yet these word embeddings have not been investigated for the task of cyberbullying detection. In this paper, we carried out a series of experiments as part of a comparative study on both slang-based and classic non-slang-based word embeddings to see how they represent potentially offensive terms, and how useful they are for detecting different types of cyberbullying. Our results show that slang-based word embeddings are better than the classic word embeddings at capturing more offensive words that are related to sensitive topics like race and gender, and they also significantly outperform classic embeddings at the task of cyberbullying detection. We further show that the difference between datasets that contain various types of cyberbullying exists in the form of subtle language rather than the mere presence of offensive words that are associated with these types of cyberbullying. Our results show that some word embeddings are better than others at classifying offensive words into categories defined by Hurtlex, but we do not find strong evidence that the same word embeddings will necessarily work best when identifying cyberbullying text that contains words from the same Hurtlex category.
