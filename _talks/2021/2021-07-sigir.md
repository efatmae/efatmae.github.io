Abstract:
==========
Social media have brought threats like cyberbullying, which can
lead to stress, anxiety, depression and in some severe cases, suicide
attempts. Detecting cyberbullying can help to warn/ block bullies
and provide support to victims. However, very few studies have
used self-attention-based language models like BERT for cyberbullying
detection and they typically only report BERT’s performance
without examining in depth the reasons for its performance. In
this work, we examine the use of BERT for cyberbullying detection
on various datasets and attempt to explain its performance by
analysing its attention weights and gradient-based feature importance
scores for textual and linguistic features. Our results show
that attention weights do not correlate with feature importance
scores and thus do not explain the model’s performance. Additionally,
they suggest that BERT relies on syntactical biases in the
datasets to assign feature importance scores to class-related words
rather than cyberbullying-related linguistic features.
