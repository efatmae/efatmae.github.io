abstract: "In recent years, grey social media platforms,
those with a loose moderation policy on cyber-
bullying, have been attracting more users. Re-
cently, data collected from these types of plat-
forms have been used to pre-train word embed-
dings (social-media-based), yet these word em-
beddings have not been investigated for social
NLP related tasks. In this paper, we carried
out a comparative study between social-media-
based and non-social-media-based word em-
beddings on two social NLP tasks: Detecting
cyberbullying and Measuring social bias. Our
results show that using social-media-based
word embeddings as input features, rather than
non-social-media-based embeddings, leads to
better cyberbullying detection performance.
We also show that some word embeddings
are more useful than others for categoriz-
ing offensive words. However, we do not
find strong evidence that certain word embed-
dings will necessarily work best when identify-
ing certain categories of cyberbullying within
our datasets. Finally, We show even though
most of the state-of-the-art bias metrics ranked
social-media-based word embeddings as the
most socially biased, these results remain in-
conclusive and further research is required."
