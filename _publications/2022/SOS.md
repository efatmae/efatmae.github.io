abstract: "Systematic Offensive stereotyping (SOS) in
word embeddings could lead to associating
marginalised groups with hate speech and pro-
fanity, which might lead to blocking and silenc-
ing those groups, especially on social media
platforms. In this work, we introduce a quan-
titative measure of the SOS bias, validate it
in the most commonly used word embeddings,
and investigate if it explains the performance
of different word embeddings on the task of
hate speech detection. Results show that SOS
bias exists in almost all examined word embed-
dings and that the proposed SOS bias metric
correlates positively with the statistics of pub-
lished surveys on online extremism. We also
show that the proposed metric reveals distinct
information compared to established social bias
metrics. However, we do not find evidence
that SOS bias explains the performance of hate
speech detection models based on the different
word embeddings."
