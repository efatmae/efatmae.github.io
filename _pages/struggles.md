Research is a very interesting field. It's the only path that forces me to keep learning
and challenging myself. However, it is difficult and full of set backs and undesired results.
Almost all the websites of the established or new researches talks only about their success stories, publication and awards.
I've started my research career since 2014 and so far it has not been so successful but also full of opportunities and small successes.
This blog is meant to record my unsuccessful attempts in academia and research. The successful attempts are published in "Publications" and "Awards".
