<p>I’m interested in social science computing. In particular, using ML and NLP to explore the opportunities and threats of social media. </p>

More generally, I’m interested in developing tools to mitigate the dark
side of social media. My first research goal is the detection of
users experiencing an echo chamber environment and providing
them with a healthy variety in their news feeds. The
second goal is using social media as a tool for improving mental
health by detecting potential mental health problems and developing tools
that might offer help. I’m considering approaching these research goals
from the perspective of Natural language understanding using tools such as
multimodal models (text and images) and model compression.
