Hello, my name is Fatma Elsafoury and I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of the West of Scotland.

Research
========
<p>In my research, I'm interested in social science computing. In particular, social bias, toxicity, hate speech, 
and fairness. My research interests stem from being a woman from an underrepresented group of people. 
I understand from my personal and research experiences how bias in NLP and ML applications has a direct 
impact on the lives of the under-represented groups of people and how hate speech towards minorities has 
severe implications on society like hate crimes. I'm interested in understanding 
how social biases impact the decisions made by ML models regarding toxicity and hate speech detection.
In particular, I'm working on a very important and interesting research question, What is the effect of social and 
intersectional biases on the task of hate speech and abuse detection?</p>
