My name is Fatma Elsafoury and I'm a postdoc at the Weizenbaum institute in Berlin. I joined the Data, Algorithmic Systems and Ethics research group. 


Research
========
<p>In my research, I'm interested in social science computing. In particular, social bias, toxicity, hate speech, 
and fairness. My research interests stem from being a woman from an underrepresented group of people. 
I understand from my personal and research experiences how bias in NLP and ML applications has a direct 
impact on the lives of the under-represented groups of people and how hate speech towards minorities has 
severe implications on society like hate crimes. I'm interested in understanding 
how social biases impact the decisions made by ML models regarding toxicity and hate speech detection.</p>

I've been an active member in my community by organising the **Women_in_NLP** talk series where I have invited 10 women, so far, from **Google, Microsoft, Rasa, Allen AI, Carnegie Mellon University** and others to discuss their research and share their experience in NLP to encourage more women to work on NLP projects.
