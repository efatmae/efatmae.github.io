I'm a PhD student and a KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) research associate at the university of the West of Scotland (UWS).

Research
========
I'm interested in studying the opportunities and threats of social media.
Recently, I became interested in studying the bias in pre-trained NLP models like BERT and Word Embeddings.
