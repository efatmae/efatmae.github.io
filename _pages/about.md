I am a PhD student in the computer science department at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany.
I am part of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PVS/en/index.html) supervised by Professor Sergei Gorlatch.
Ever since my master studies, I have been actively contributing to the [Lift Project](http://www.lift-project.org) in collaboration with Dr Michel Steuwer (University of Glasgow) and Dr Christophe Dubach (University of Edinburgh) and performed multiple successful research visits every year.
I am interested in code generation and compilers for parallel systems with a special focus on [stencil computations](http://www.lift-project.org/stencils) and program optimization using rewrite rules.

Research Abstract
======
In my research, I aim to achieve performance-portability, that is to allow a single portable program to be executed with high performance across a diverse set of computer architectures. 
I am tackling this ambitious challenge by proving a tool chain which combines high-level programming abstractions and modern compiler technology by exploiting application and architecture domain knowledge.
My work on optimizing [stencil computations](/publications/2018/CGO) has shown that it is possible to have an expressive, generic high-level language in which problems are specified while at the same generating high performance code which matches or outperforms hand optimized reference implementations. 
In the future, I plan to use these ideas to develop a flexible DSL for tensor computations which will be compiled into a novel AI domain specific IR allowing to experiment with optimizations and use modern code generation techniques to generate high performance GPU code.

You can find a more detailled description of my research [here](/research).
