Research
========
I'm interested in exploring the opportunities and threats social media.
In particular, detecting cyberbullying/hate speech, mental health problems and echo chamber environments.

To achieve that, I use Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse user generated content.
