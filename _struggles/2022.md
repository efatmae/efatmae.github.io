<b>ACL, Feb 2022</b>
I restrctured the paper rejected from the WOAH workshop looked at the work from a different perspective and submitted the paper to ACL ARR september round. I got some reviews that I addressed and resubitted it in the Novemebr round. Then we got 2 new reviewers with new reviews. The paper recieved mixed scores 3.5, and 4 from older reviewers and 1.5 and 2.5 from the new reviewrs. The meta-review score was the same in the Sept nad Nov rounds which is 3.

I commited the paper to ACL 2022 but it was rejected.
