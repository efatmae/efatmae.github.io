<b>Dec 2020 </b>
My first full paper to the ECIR 2021 conference is rejected. Most of the feedback from the reviewers is reasonable and useful. I was looking forward to get similar feedback on my research to develop it and make it better.
However, it is still disappointing and discouraging sometimes. I'll work on the paper and resubmit it.
