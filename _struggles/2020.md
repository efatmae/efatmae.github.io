<b>Dec 2020 </b>
My first full paper to the ECIR 2021 conference is rejected with
score 0(borderline), -3(string reject) and -1 (weak reject)

I'll work on the feedback and resubmit the paper.
The reason of publishing this is to have a realistic record of an academic
journey. I'll record all the struggles here and the success
under "awards" and "publications" sections. I hope this record may help another
young researcher who might get discouraged with the initial outcomes of her/his research.
